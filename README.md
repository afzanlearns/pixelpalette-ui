## 🚀 Project Overview

PixelPalette UI is a frontend-only project focused on **clarity, interaction quality, and visual learning**.  
Instead of acting purely as a component gallery, the project now combines:

- A curated UI component showcase
- A comprehensive Tailwind CSS properties reference
- Intentional design constraints to maintain consistency and polish

The result is a focused, professional interface that feels closer to a real internal design system tool than a demo project.
